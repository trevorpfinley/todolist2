## Important Notes About Notifications

**Browser notifications only work when:**
- The website is open in a browser tab
- You've granted notification permissions
- Your browser supports notifications (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

**Limitations:**
- Tasks are saved locally per browser (won't sync between phone and laptop automatically)
- Notifications won't work when the browser is closed
- You need to keep the tab open for reminders to trigger

## How to Use

1. **Add a task**: Type in the input box and click "Add Task" or press Enter
2. **Set a reminder**: Pick a date/time before adding the task
3. **Complete a task**: Click the checkbox next to the task
4. **Delete a task**: Click the "Delete" button
5. **Filter tasks**: Use All/Active/Completed buttons to filter your view
6. **Clear completed**: Remove all completed tasks at once

## Tips

- Allow notifications when your browser asks for permission
- Keep the tab open for reminders to work
- Bookmark the page for quick access
- Use it on both your phone and laptop by visiting the same URL

Enjoy your new to-do list! 📝
